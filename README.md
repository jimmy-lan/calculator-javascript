# JavaScript Calculator

A classic calculator made using JavaScript.
The feature of this calculator may seem easy-to-implement at first, but the actual implementation requires a good understanding of JavaScript and programming logic.
This project was inspired by an online course that was not mandatory for my studies or work.

> **Important:** This project is made during leisure time and is not maintained.
